            <h1> Responsible gambling</h1>
            Gambling has got a bad reputation, and for good reason too. Almost all gamblers lose money. That is not a problem in itself, because we spend money on many different kinds
            of entertainment. The problem arises when you lose more money than you should, because you get caught up in the heat of the moment.
            <br>
            But I think that an even bigger issue is the emotional torn it takes on many people. It stops being funny and becommes more of an obsession.
            <br>
            I believe that the right way to deal with the issue is to educate our youngsters how to gamble responsibly. I will in time make this page about that.
            <br>
            I will combine it with advertising for bookmakers. This is not neccesarily a contradiction, because my goal is not to make people stop gambling, but to 
            make them gamble responsibly in a way that gives them pleasure not pain.
